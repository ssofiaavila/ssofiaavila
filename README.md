## Hello! 👋
I am an Argentinian semi-senior software engineer specializing in React and .NET technologies, currently part of the foreign trade development team at Banco Galicia.

I have been interested in the world of development since I began my university studies in 2020 at the National University of La Plata and in January 2023 I began my professional career.
